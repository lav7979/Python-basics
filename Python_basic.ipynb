        "          **Python Basics Questions**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "      Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It's popular due to its versatile libraries, large community support, and use in web development, data science, automation, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "      An interpreter reads and executes Python code line by line, converting it into machine code during runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "      \n",
        "      Pre-defined keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in Python (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`). They cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "      \n",
        "      No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved for Python syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "      \n",
        "      Mutability refers to whether an object’s value can be changed after it's created. Mutable objects can be changed (e.g., lists), while immutable ones cannot (e.g., tuples).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "      \n",
        "      Lists are designed for dynamic data that might change, so they are mutable. Tuples are meant to represent fixed collections of items, so they are immutable for reliability and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between `==` and `is` operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "      `==` checks if values are equal.\n",
        "      `is` checks if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n",
        "      \n",
        "      `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "      Type casting is converting one data type into another, such as converting a string to an integer using `int(\"5\")`.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "       *Implicit* type casting is done automatically by Python (e.g., converting `int` to `float` in an expression).\n",
        "       *Explicit* type casting is manually done by the programmer using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "      Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions and execute certain blocks of code based on conditions (e.g., using `if`, `elif`, and `else`).\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the `elif` statement work?\n",
        "      `elif` (short for \"else if\") checks another condition if the previous `if` condition was False. It allows for multiple conditions to be checked in sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between `for` and `while` loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "       `for` loops are used for iterating over a sequence (like a list or range).\n",
        "       `while` loops run as long as a condition is True, making them suitable for uncertain or infinite loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a `while` loop is more suitable than a `for` loop.\n",
        "      A `while` loop is better when the number of iterations is not known in advance—e.g., reading input from a user until they type \"exit\".\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
